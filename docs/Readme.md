## Overview

Oh Hey! has two main features currently:
- Notifying you when someone targets you
- Notifying you when someone emotes at you.

The plugin notifies you with a text message(only visible to you) and can optionally play a notification sound.\
Additionally it tracks the most recent notification events with a simple interface.
